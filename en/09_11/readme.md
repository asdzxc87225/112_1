沒什麼特別的事件，就是老師見過肯德基爺爺。
再來是乖乖到課就好。

# Class Policies

1. Students must bring their own Chinese-English, English-hinese dictionaries to every class.
2. Regular classroom attendance is emphasized \
  learning is expounded through propinquity and the regular,repeawted exposure to the language and subject. Therefore, class attendance and participation is paramount.\
   Additional assignments are available to remeby a missed class or a flagging score.\
   Excessive absences or tardies WILL affect class grade.
1. Sleeping and using electronic devices for entertainment(e.g. video games, cell phones, instant messaging) are not allowed in the classroom. Attention must be plced on class activities at all times.
1. Students are expected to exercise and develop a mutual and professional-quality respect for others. \
  Students will be praised for the dignified skills of LISTENING, observation and entertaining new ideas proposed by others.\
  Critical thinking is strongly encouraged, but a critical attitude is not. Students should be aware that social rejection and ideological ignorance oppose learning and development, and should therefore be slow to point out the thoughts and opinions of others as being poor or wrong.\
  Students who display scorn and mockery towards others who stand in error, or who are embarrassed, will not be tolerated.Those who make it difficult for others to speak and/or learn will be dismissed from class for the day.

# Class content
- wave - on oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medivm.
- Oscillation - the repetitive variation, typically in time, of some measure about a central valve (offen a point of equilibrium) or between two or more different states.

## Properties of Waves 
- Wavelength - the distance between the peaks of a wave.
- Amplitvde - The maximum degree of displacement or oscillation energy theat a wave possesses.
- Wave Velocity - The distance traversed by a periodic, or cyclic motion per unit time. The wave velocity is equal to the product of its wavelength and frequency (number of vibrations per second) and is independent of its intensity.

## Physical Types of Waves 

- Longitudinal wave
- Mechanical wave 
- Periodic wave 
- Pulse wave 
- Transverse wave 

## Transverse Waves VS. Longitudinal Waves

- Transverse Wave - Oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of motion.
- Longitudinal Wave - Oscillation is parallel to the direction of motion.
- O-Physics: A Comparison of Transverse Waves and Longitudinal Waves 

## Transverse Wave interference 

- Interference - The combination of two or more waveforms to form a resultant wave.
- Superposition - The combined effect of two or more seemingly unrelated characteristics or events.
- Constructive Interference - he interference of two or more waves of equal frequency and phase, resulting in their mutual reinforcement and producing a single amplitude equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves.
- Dstructive Interference - The interference of two waves of equal frequency and oppositte phase, resulting in their cancellation where the negative displacement of one always conincies with the positive displacement of the other.

## standing Waves 
Standing Waves have no net wave velocity. 
- Node - A point or reginon of virtually zero amplitude in a wave or periodic system.
- Anli-Node - For a standing wave, the region or point of maximum amplitude between adjacent nodes.
